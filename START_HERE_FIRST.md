## ❓ FAQ

**Q: What if Docker doesn't work?**  
A: Documented in `YOUR_ACTION_PLAN.md` with troubleshooting steps. Can continue without Docker for now - dev server works standalone.

**Q: When will Phase 2 start?**  
A: Immediately after you signal "ready" and Docker is fixed. Phase 2A takes 3-4 hours to complete database integration.

**Q: Do I need Permify right now?**  
A: No. Phase 2B (permissions) isn't blocking. Can start Phase 2A without it. Permify key needed by Phase 2B.

**Q: How do I add a new API endpoint?**  
A: Look at `src/app/api/vendors/route.ts` or `src/app/api/employees/route.ts` for patterns. Use `protectedApiHandler()` wrapper from `src/lib/api-helpers.ts`.

**Q: Is the code production-ready?**  
A: Build is production-ready (0 errors, optimized). API endpoints are using mock data - need Phase 2A to connect real database.

**Q: What if I don't have time to read everything?**  
A: Read just:
1. This file (5 min)
2. `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` (5 min)
3. `YOUR_ACTION_PLAN.md` (5 min)

Total: 15 minutes. That's enough to know what to do.
