## 🧪 Test Cases

### Test 1: User Creation Form Loads
- [ ] Start app: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Navigate to: `/dashboard/users`
- [ ] Click: "Create New User"
- [ ] Check: Role dropdown shows options
- [ ] Verify: At least 3 roles visible
- **Expected**: ✅ Pass

### Test 2: Roles Page Loads
- [ ] Navigate to: `/dashboard/users/roles`
- [ ] Check: Roles table/list shows data
- [ ] Verify: Role name, description visible
- [ ] Count: At least 3 roles displayed
- **Expected**: ✅ Pass

### Test 3: Create User with Role
- [ ] Fill user form with test data
- [ ] Select: Any role from dropdown
- [ ] Click: "Create User"
- [ ] Check: Success message
- [ ] Verify: User appears in list with role
- **Expected**: ✅ Pass

### Test 4: User Login After Creation
- [ ] Use new user credentials to login
- [ ] Check: User authenticates successfully
- [ ] Verify: User has assigned role
- **Expected**: ✅ Pass

### Test 5: Console Logs
- [ ] Open browser console (F12)
- [ ] Check for: `[getAllRoles] Fetched X roles`
- [ ] Check: No error messages
- [ ] Verify: Clean startup logs
- **Expected**: ✅ No errors

### Test 6: API Endpoint
- [ ] Call: `GET /api/admin/roles`
- [ ] Verify: Returns roles array
- [ ] Check: Each role has id, name
- **Expected**: ✅ 200 OK with roles

### Test 7: Permission Scenarios
- [ ] Test as admin user
