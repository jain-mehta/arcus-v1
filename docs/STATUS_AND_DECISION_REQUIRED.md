## 🎯 THREE EXECUTION PATHS

### Path A: Minimal MVP (10 days)
**Focus:** Vendor, Product, PO → core flow only

```
Week 1:
  - Middleware JWT verification (4h)
  - API endpoints for Vendor, Product, PO (16h)
  - Basic seeding (4h)

Week 2:
  - Integration tests (8h)
  - Documentation (4h)
  - Bug fixes (4h)
```

**Result:** Functional SaaS with core features  
**Not included:** Sales Orders, Inventory, Employee management

---

### Path B: Full Feature MVP (16 days)
**Focus:** All domain entities + full workflows

```
Week 1:
  - Middleware JWT verification (4h)
  - API endpoints - all entities (25h)

Week 2:
  - Data seeding (6h)
  - Integration & E2E tests (12h)
  - Documentation (4h)

Week 3:
  - Bug fixes & refinement (4h)
  - Staging deployment (4h)
```

**Result:** Complete SaaS platform ready for production  
**Includes:** All features, full testing, documentation

---

### Path C: Enterprise Ready (21 days)
**Focus:** All features + DevOps + Observability

```
Week 1:
  - Middleware & API endpoints (29h)

Week 2:
  - Seeding, testing, docs (26h)

Week 3:
  - CI/CD, monitoring, infrastructure (16h)
  - Final testing & deployment (8h)
```

**Result:** Production-grade platform with monitoring, CI/CD, IaC  
**Includes:** Everything from Path B + automation, observability, scalability

## 💬 CRITICAL QUESTIONS FOR YOU

### 1. **Timeline**
- When do you need this production-ready?
- Days? Weeks? Months?

### 2. **Scope**
- **Path A** (Vendor + Product + PO only) - 10 days
- **Path B** (All features) - 16 days
- **Path C** (All features + DevOps) - 21 days
- Or custom scope?

### 3. **Resources**
- Do you have a team to help with testing/QA?
- Will you handle infrastructure/DevOps?
- Do you need me to do everything?

### 4. **Quality Standards**
