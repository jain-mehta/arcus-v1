## 📝 Developer Notes

### Permission Structure Format

```typescript
{
  moduleName: {
    label: 'User-Friendly Module Name',
    description: 'What this module controls',
    permissions: {
      permissionKey: {
        label: 'Permission Name',
        description: 'What this permission allows'
      }
    }
    // OR for modules with submodules
    submodules: {
      submoduleName: {
        label: 'Submodule Name',
        description: 'Submodule purpose',
        permissions: {
          // same as above
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Adding New Permissions

1. Update `MODULE_PERMISSIONS` in `roles-new-client.tsx`
2. Add permission to relevant submodule
3. Include label and description
4. Update MOCK_ROLES in `firestore.ts`
5. Test in UI to verify display

### Backend Integration

Permissions are stored as nested objects:
```json
{
  "sales": {
    "leads": {
      "view": true,
      "create": true
    }
  }
}
```

Backend checks:
```typescript
if (user.permissions.sales?.leads?.view === true) {
  // Allow access
}
```
