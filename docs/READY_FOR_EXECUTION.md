## 🎬 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (If approved)

### Day 1 (Start Today)
```bash
# I implement middleware JWT verification
# You review and approve

Files created:
├── Enhanced middleware.ts (JWT verification)
├── src/lib/api-helpers.ts (standard API pattern)
└── Tests for middleware

Deliverable: All API routes now protected with JWT
```

### Day 2-3
```bash
# I create all API endpoints

├── src/app/api/purchase-orders/
├── src/app/api/sales-orders/
├── src/app/api/inventory/
└── src/app/api/employees/

Deliverable: 30+ working API endpoints
```

### Day 4-5
```bash
# I create data seeding scripts and tests
# Sample data loaded into databases

Files created:
├── scripts/seed/
├── src/__tests__/
└── e2e/

Deliverable: Full test coverage, sample data ready
```

### Day 6-7
```bash
# I complete documentation and final polish
# Everything documented and deployment-ready

Files created:
├── docs/DEVELOPERS_GUIDE.md
