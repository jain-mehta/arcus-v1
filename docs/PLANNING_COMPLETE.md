## 🎯 Key Findings from Gap Analysis

### What's Ready (Frontend)
✅ Next.js App Router fully functional  
✅ UI for all 9 modules present  
✅ Server actions scaffolded  
✅ Firebase authentication working (client)  
✅ Mock data layer complete (keeps UI running)

### What's Missing (Backend & Infra)
❌ TypeORM entities for domain objects (vendor, product, order, employee, etc.)  
❌ Supabase Auth integration (JWT + JWKS)  
❌ Control-plane database (sessions, user_mappings, tenant_metadata)  
❌ Per-tenant database provisioning  
❌ Docker & local dev environment  
❌ Permify policy engine integration  
❌ Migrations (control-plane + domain)  
❌ CI/CD pipelines  
❌ Terraform infrastructure skeleton

### Architecture Decisions Confirmed
✅ **Tenancy Model:** Per-tenant database (create-on-demand via Supabase Admin API)  
✅ **Auth:** Supabase Auth + JWT with `jti` claim for revocation  
✅ **Policy Engine:** Permify with live schema sync  
✅ **ORM:** TypeORM + Postgres  
✅ **Local Dev:** Docker Compose (Postgres, Redis, MinIO, app)  
✅ **Deployment:** GitHub Actions CI (lint, test, build); Terraform skeleton

## 📊 Sprint 1 Summary (Oct 27 – Nov 10)

### Goal
Deliver foundational infrastructure: control-plane DB, middleware PoC, Docker dev environment, JWT auth flow

### Key Tasks
| Task | Effort | Owner | Deliverable |
|------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Control-plane entities | 12h | Backend Lead | `src/entities/control/*.ts` |
| Migrations (SQL) | 6h | Backend Lead | `migrations/control/*.sql` |
| Tenant provisioning CLI | 10h | DevOps | `scripts/provision-tenant-db.mjs` |
| Docker + Compose | 12h | DevOps | `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.dev.yml` |
| JWT middleware | 10h | Backend Lead | `src/middleware.ts` + helpers |
| Middleware tests | 8h | QA | `src/__tests__/middleware.test.ts` |
| Control-plane seeding | 6h | Backend Lead | `scripts/seed/*.ts` |
| Documentation | 4h | Tech Writer | `.env.template` + docs |

### Success Criteria (25 checklist items)
- [ ] Docker Compose starts all services, all healthchecks pass
- [ ] Control-plane DB created with 4 tables + indices
- [ ] JWT middleware verifies tokens correctly (JWKS endpoint)
- [ ] Session revocation check working (revoked JWT → 401)
- [ ] Tenant provisioning script tested and working
- [ ] Seeded with admin user, default roles, sample tenant
- [ ] All unit tests pass (> 80% coverage)
- [ ] `.env.template` + DOCKER_SETUP.md documented and clear
- [ ] Team can spin up local env end-to-end in < 5 min
- ... (15 more)

### Team Capacity
- Backend Lead: 36 hours available (40h/week × 2 weeks, minus meeting/review overhead)
- Backend Engineer: 20 hours
- DevOps: 12 hours
- QA: 4 hours
- **Total Sprint 1:** ~70 hours (well within team capacity of ~240 available)

### Expected Outcome
✅ Running Docker environment with all services healthy  
✅ Control-plane DB provisioned with sample tenant  
✅ JWT authentication flow working end-to-end  
✅ Middleware PoC tested (happy path + error cases)  
✅ Team can continue building domain entities in Sprint 2 without blocking
