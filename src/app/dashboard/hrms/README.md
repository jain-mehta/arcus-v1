# HRMS Module

This document provides an overview of the Human Resource Management System (HRMS) module.

## 1. Purpose

The HRMS module is designed to manage all employee-related information and processes within the organization. It provides tools for administrators and managers to handle everything from recruitment and onboarding to payroll and performance reviews.

## 2. Sub-modules

The HRMS module is broken down into the following key sub-modules:

-   **Dashboard (`/dashboard/hrms`):** Provides a high-level overview of key HR metrics, such as total employee count, attendance trends, and pending approvals.

-   **Employee Directory (`/dashboard/hrms/employees`):** A central repository for all employee profiles. Admins can add, view, and manage staff details, while managers can track shift activities like clock-in/out times.

-   **Attendance & Shifts (`/dashboard/hrms/attendance`):** A visual dashboard for tracking live employee attendance and managing weekly shift schedules.

-   **Leave Management (`/dashboard/hrms/leaves`):** An end-to-end system for managing employee leave. Employees can apply for leave, and managers can approve or reject requests.

-   **Payroll (`/dashboard/hrms/payroll`):** A comprehensive tool for processing monthly payroll. It allows for the creation of salary structures, automatic calculation of payslips, and generation of reports.

-   **Compliance & Documents (`/dashboard/hrms/compliance`):** A secure location for managing statutory compliance documents (e.g., PF, ESI) and company-wide policies. It also provides a personal document locker for employees.

-   **Performance Management (`/dashboard/hrms/performance`):** A module for defining Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and managing performance review cycles. It includes a complete workflow for employee self-assessments and manager appraisals.

-   **Recruitment (`/dashboard/hrms/recruitment`):** An Applicant Tracking System (ATS) for managing job openings and tracking candidates through the hiring pipeline, from application to offer.

-   **Announcements (`/dashboard/hrms/announcements`):** A central hub for posting company-wide announcements and maintaining a library of important policy documents.

-   **Reports & Analytics (`/dashboard/hrms/reports`):** A dedicated section for visualizing HR data, including headcount by department, leave consumption analysis, and other key workforce metrics.
