# 🎯 ROLES LOADING FIX - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## ✅ STATUS: COMPLETE & READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

---

## 📌 The Problem

**What**: Roles were not loading in the application  
**Where**: User creation form, roles page, hierarchy  
**Impact**: Cannot create users or assign roles  
**Error**: `[getAllUsers] Error fetching user roles: {}`

---

## 🔧 The Solution

**Root Cause**: Two functions that should fetch roles had this:
```typescript
// TODO: Implement
return [];  // Always empty!
```

**Fix**: Implemented proper database queries to fetch real role data
